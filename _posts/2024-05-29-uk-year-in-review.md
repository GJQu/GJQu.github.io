There already exist numerous articles and blog posts on graduate school advice such as the one from superstar Economist [Susan Athey's Professional Advice for Students](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/professional-advice/), or this one by [EconPhD.net](https://econphd.econwiki.com/guide.htm). Therefore, I will limit the scope of this blog post in terms of my own anecdotal experience. For the unfamiliar, the field of economics is the study of human behavior from the individual level to the nation level and beyond, the field today largely reflects a quantitative science that relies heavily on mathematical and computational. 

## My Previous Life
My experience might sound relatable to many young economics undergraduates, at least from my own observation - there's never a short supply of eager economic students walking into intermediate microeconomic classes at my university. But unlike computer science or computer engineering, who go on and become software engineers or researchers, how many economics students actually go on to become economists or work in an economic field? I would guess very little do, many of my economics friends went on and became accounts, business analysts and pivoted into technology (all are distinguished in their own ways). I am not arguing for or against the market signals of an economics undergraduate education, but simply to state my observations. Usually, undergraduate economics in the U.S. are fairly light on the rigorous math required for graduate school and field work in economics, I found this out in my sophomore year (2nd year). Generally, one should have good intuitions of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, proofs and probability/statistics. Once I realized this, I took as many math classes as my schedule allowed, and it was interesting being the only economics major in those classes. In retrospect, I should've double majored or minored in Mathematics, but it doesn't stop me from learning them on my own, especially with the amazing resource we have with [ossu/math](https://github.com/ossu/math). 

In 2020, a global pandemic uprooted my plan entirely, all my classes that quarter were either cancelled 2/3 of the way or delayed until further notice. I still had plans for graduate school in Economics, but the fog of uncertainty associated with the pandemic casted doubts on my original plan of applying to PhD programs right away. I just started my 3rd year of college at the University of Washington, and it's not off to a great start. Once the dust settled in my senior year, I decided to gain some work experience after I graduate where I ended up working in payroll accounting for a year at a Fortune 500 company. 

After a year of said accounting work, I decided that I ought to pursue what I felt was incomplete at the time, which is my economics journey. Due to the lack of math requirements, undergraduate economics departments in general have a huge discrepancy in terms of what can be taught and what should be taught in an economics education. I believe this is where the incompleteness lies in my own undergraduate education. Therefore, I started emailing professors and mentors, which was followed by a flurry of graduate school applications to master's programs in economics. 

## Europe vs. the U.S. 
In general, European master's programs in Economics are more rigorous and higher value than the U.S. programs. I believe this is largely due to the structure of education systems, where the U.S. focuses on PhD programs and usually terminal masters are rare in this field. Many European undergrad are already done in 3 years, where you concentrate on your intended major only. Where in the US, there are certain general education requirements that allows students to explore their interests in their first year. Therefore, a terminal master's may not sound as attractive given the differential in opportunity cost under the U.S. system. Also, graduate program usually takes 1 year in the UK and many EU countries, it's essentially a PhD lite experience. This was perfect for me, because I wasn't sure if my background was competitive enough for a PhD in the US right away or if I'm fully committed to spending the next 6 year to Economics research. Below is the spreadsheet I used to track my applications for this process.

Ultimately, after some careful deliberations, I chose University of Essex to do pursue a MS in Economics due to its research output rankings (and since Oxford/LSE didn't accept me into their programs). 

## Nine Months Later... 
I'm happy with my choice,
