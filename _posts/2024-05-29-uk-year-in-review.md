There already exist numerous articles and blog posts on graduate school advice such as the one from the superstar Economist [Susan Athey's Professional Advice for Students](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/professional-advice/), or this one by [EconPhD.net](https://econphd.econwiki.com/guide.htm). Therefore, I will limit the scope of this blog post in terms of my own anecdotal experience. For the unfamiliar, the field of economics is the study of human behavior from the individual level to the nation-level and beyond, the field today largely reflects a quantitative science that relies heavily on mathematical and computational modeling. 

## My Previous Life
My experience might sound relatable to many young economics undergraduates, at least from my own observation - there's never a short supply of eager economic students walking into intermediate microeconomic classes at my university. Unlike computer science or computer engineering students, who go on to become software engineers or researchers, how many economics students actually go on to become economists or work in an economic field? I would guess very little do, many of my economics friends went on and became accountants, business analysts and pivoted into technology (all are distinguished in their own ways). I am not arguing for or against the market signals of an economics undergraduate education, but simply to state my observations. Usually, undergraduate economics departments in the U.S. are fairly light on the rigorous math required for graduate school and field work in economics, I found this out in my sophomore year (2nd year). Generally, one should have good intuitions of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, proofs and probability/statistics. Once I realized this, I took as many math classes as my schedule allowed, and it was interesting being the only economics major in those classes. In retrospect, I should've double majored or minored in Mathematics, but that doesn't stop me from learning math on my own these days, especially with the amazing resource we have with [ossu/math](https://github.com/ossu/math). 

In 2020, a global pandemic uprooted my plans, all my classes that quarter were either cancelled 2/3 of the way or delayed until further notice. I still had plans for graduate school in Economics, but the fog of uncertainty associated with the pandemic casted doubts on my original plan of applying to PhD programs right away. I just started my 3rd year of college at the University of Washington, and it's not off to a great start. Once the dust settled in my senior year, I decided to gain some work experience after I graduate where I ended up working in payroll accounting for a year at a Fortune 500 company. 

After a year of said accounting work, I decided that I ought to pursue what I felt was incomplete at the time, which is my economics journey. Due to the lack of math requirements, undergraduate economics departments in general have a huge discrepancy in terms of what can be taught and what should be taught in an economics education. I believe this is where the incompleteness lies in my own undergraduate education. Therefore, I started emailing professors and mentors, which was followed by a flurry of graduate school applications to master's programs in economics. 

## Europe vs. the U.S. 
In general, European master's programs in Economics are more rigorous and higher value than the U.S. programs. I believe this is largely due to the structure of education systems, where the U.S. focuses on PhD programs and terminal masters are rare in this field. Many European undergrad are already done in 3 years, where you concentrate on your intended major only. Where in the US, there are certain general education requirements that allow students to explore their interests in the first year of university. Therefore, a terminal master's may not sound as attractive given the differential in opportunity cost under the U.S. system. Also, graduate program usually takes 1 year in the UK and many EU countries, it's essentially a PhD lite experience. "A Master's is akin to running a 5k, PhD is a marathon." This was perfect for me, because I wasn't sure if my background was competitive enough for a PhD in the US right away or if I'm fully committed to spending the next 6 year to Economics research. Below is the spreadsheet I used to track my applications for this process.

Ultimately, after some careful deliberations, I chose University of Essex to pursue a MSc in Economics because of its research output rankings (and since Oxford/LSE didn't accept me into their programs). 

## Nine Months Later... 
Lukily, I am happy with the intertemporal choice that I made 1 year prior, and I've made amazing connections with my classmates and professors. The intricacies of ARIMA time series models, the derivations of the dynamic equations that solve the capital level of the Ramsey (Neoclassical) Growth Model, and the relationship between unemployment and vacancy in the Diamond-Pissarides-Mortenson model all readied me to become a master of the (economics) universe someday. 

To my future employers reading this, here's a list of the classes I did: 

1. **Macroeconomics Analysis**
  - Solow, OLG, Endogenous Growth, Ramsey, and Pissarides Model. 
2. **Microeconomics Analysis**
  - Game Theory, Hicksian Demand, solving for general equilibrium
3. **Mathematical Methods**
  - Constrained and Unconstrained Optimization, Linear Programming, Dynamic Programming. 
4. **Econometrics Method (with matrices)**
  - OLS, Gauss-Markov, AIC/BIC, Heteroskedasticity, FGLS, Maximum Likelihood, Autocorrelation, Instrumental Variables, Unit Root, Cointegration, and Panel Methods. 
5. **Data Science Economics**
  - Lasso, Ridge, Trees, Support Vectors, Neural Nets, etc. 
6. **Causal Inference (Public Policy Analysis)**
  - RCT, Diff-in-Diff, IV, Matching, Regression Discontinuity, Quantile Treatment. 
7. **Behavioral Economics on Markets**
  - I will do a future blog on this since I think this is a fascinating field. 

## The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
Now, if you got this far reading my blog, it would be unfair of me if I do not give a thorough "review" of the UK and my experience with the program. 

The southern part of the UK actually surprised me with the days of sunshine every months, growing up in Seattle truly prepares you for the worst of Seasonal Depression. Aside from the weather, the people are quite friendly here, especially after a pint or two. One sad reality however, is the smell of sewage you'll often be greeted with in London and most part of its waterways in the Southeast. Coinincidentally, the first causal experiment in history was done by an English  epidemiologist named [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) on the Thames River in 1855, he used statistical mapping methods to ultimately identify the cause of Cholera - you guessed it - it's contaminated water. John Snow became known as the father of epidemiology because of his pioneering methods now known as difference-in-difference which is widely used in medicine and economics. 

Aside from the sewage smell and the lime-stone filled tap water in Southeastern UK, the country can be insanely beautiful, coupled with the Tudor town centers and Norman cathedrals that're rare sights in America. It might not look like Hogwarts everywhere you go, but the spirit of a once globe-trotting empire emanates in the air nonetheless. I could write multiple blogs on my travels in the UK alone. 

It's the people you meet along the way that matters - I'm very thankful for the patience of my dissertation advisor and the friends that suffered through finals week with me. Beside, now I have reasons to visit a few more places because of them, even opening up two more continents that I have yet to visit. 

## With Respect to Time
All good things must come to an end, but that doesn't mean the new beginning isn't exciting. This summer, I'm moving back to the west coast of the U.S., but now I can finally say I lived in Europe (not the EU) for a year. 

I'd love to hear your feedbacks and other topics you'd like me to write about, my email can be found at [my profile page](https://gjqu.github.io./about/).
