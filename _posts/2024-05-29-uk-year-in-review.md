There already exist numerous articles and blog posts on graduate school advice such as the one from superstar Economist [Susan Athey's Professional Advice for Students](https://gsb-faculty.stanford.edu/susan-athey/professional-advice/), or this one by [EconPhD.net](https://econphd.econwiki.com/guide.htm). Therefore, I will limit the scope of this blog post in terms of my own anecdotal experience. For the unfamiliar, the field of economics is the study of human behavior from the individual level to the nation level and beyond, the field today largely reflects a quantitative science that relies heavily on mathematical and computational. 

## My Previous Life
My experience might sound relatable to many young economics undergraduates, at least from my own observation - there's never a short supply of eager economic students walking into intermediate microeconomic classes at my university. But unlike computer science or computer engineering, who go on and become software engineers or researchers, how many economics students actually go on to become economists or work in an economic field? I would guess very little do, many of my economics friends went on and became accounts, business analysts and pivoted into technology (all are distinguished in their own ways). I am not arguing for or against the market signals of an economics undergraduate education, but simply to state my observations. Usually, undergraduate economics in the U.S. are fairly light on the rigorous math required for graduate school and field work in economics, I found this out in my sophomore year (2nd year). Generally, one should have good intuitions of calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, proofs and probability/statistics. Once I realized this, I took as many math classes as my schedule allowed, and it was interesting being the only economics major in those classes. In retrospect, I should've double majored or minored in Mathematics, but it doesn't stop me from learning them on my own, especially with the amazing resource we have with [ossu/math](https://github.com/ossu/math). 

In 2020, a global pandemic uprooted my plan entirely, all my classes that quarter were either cancelled 2/3 of the way or delayed until further notice.
