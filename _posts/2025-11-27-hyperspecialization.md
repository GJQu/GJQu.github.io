Happy Thanksgiving, everyone, I am keeping today's blog on the shorter end, an under 5-minute read and I will spare you LaTex equations. 

## What Do the Following Have in Common? 
It's Thanksgiving morning, so here's a no-stake brainstorming exercise: spend the next 3 minutes to write down as many ideas as you can, they don't need to relate to each other. Once you are done, connect the nodes of ideas and map out whatever patterns you can find. Curious for what I wrote down? 

1. Botany
2. Adam Smith 
3. FIFA (the video game by EA)
4. Thanksgiving dinner 

So what do the above have in common, if anything at all? It all started a couple nights ago while I was casually browsing for project ideas during a my study break on Discord. I follow a handful of open-source communities: Ollama, Open WebUI, Godot (the game engine). In one of the Godot voice channels, I stumbled into a conversation between an indie developer and a retired EA game dev.

### Botany and FIFA
The story goes like this, as told by the retired EA developer. A colleague of his had been hired right after finishing her PhD. She came recommended by a friend at EA who insisted, “You have to scoop her up—she just wrapped up her doctorate, and if we don’t, some other studio will.” So the team set up a panel interview.

They asked about her PhD and got a bewildering response: “Botany,” she said, the scientific study of plants. She hadn’t learned any programming until she began working on her thesis. You can imagine the confusion on the interviewers’ faces. “Okay… fascinating. But do you have any experience with game development, or have you played many games?” They were trying not to assume too much. She thought for a moment; she wasn’t really a gamer. “Not really. But I remember watching my boyfriend play one of EA’s racing titles—Need for Speed. I noticed the maple trees in one of the maps didn’t match the region.”

The room perked up as she explained: “The eastern maples in that environment wouldn’t have the bark pattern shown in the game. And as they mature, the taller ones should develop a different pattern than the younger ones.”

After a short pause, one interviewer finally said, “We did research the trees, but if we added all that specificity across the whole game, do you know how hard it would be to optimize performance?”

She replied, “I think I know a way. My thesis involved computational simulations across different plant species—and how to optimize them.”

That was the moment the panel understood why she’d been referred. She was hired and went on to work on plant physics and environmental systems across several EA titles. When players glide across the turf in FIFA and the grass behaves just right—that was her team’s handiwork.

My mind was blown hearing this story. Then the economics of comparative advantage slid back into view, and I haven’t stopped thinking about it since.

### Adam Smith Joins the Chat (pun intended)
Here's a quick refresher of comparative advantage versus absolute advantage: 

1. Comparative advantage is about which producer of goods has lower opportunity cost, in other words, who gives up less while producing the same thing. 
    - One can say that China has long held a comparative advantage in iPhone assembly. 
2. Absolute advantage describes a producer that can produce something with fewer resources, all else equal.  
    - The American software industry has enjoyed this for decades, especially since the 1960s. 

This concept of comparative and absolute advantages doesn't just apply to an entire companies or the economy, it applies to individuals too. It was first posited by the economist and philosopher Adam Smith in *The Wealth of Nations* (1776), although the idea itself is quite ancient and can be traced by to the Roman times or earlier. Below is the famous pin-factory example in the first chapter of the book on the *division of labor*. 

> "I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day."

Smith pointed out that if those same workers attempted the entire process independently, chances are they won't even manage twenty pins a day. He was a big proponent of free trade, pushing for trade based on productive superiority (absolute advantage) rather than the targeted mercantilism of his era. 

Later on, David Ricardo extended Smith's ideas in 1817. He showed that absolute advantage cannot explain all trade. Comparative advantage, where opportunity cost of a producer determines the pareto-efficient (term not yet used at his time) outcome of international trade. This reveals that even a country superior at everything still benefits from specializing where it gives up the least. Trade becomes mutually beneficial not because of dominance, but because of relative sacrifice. 

Both comparative advantage and absolute advantage show up today in patterns of specialization and productivity differences in various economic models. 

### Thanksgiving Dishes and the Division of Labor
Every year, my family gets together to make our spread of holiday dishes. I’m the one in charge of the cranberry sauce and a potato-and-ham casserole. My father is up at 6 a.m. tending the brisket or ribeye in the smoker, while my mom handles the desserts and the turkey. Over the years, my cranberry sauce has evolved into a Thanksgiving staple. My father’s smoked ribeye has become so popular that it reliably draws family friends to our table—and brings a bit of extra stress with it. I’m sure your own family and friends have their version of this division of labor during the holiday rush.

We are not explicitly trading our products of labor during thanksgiving day, but the dish-prepping process itself is eerily similar to that gripping story of the game studio developer, and Adam Smith's pin-factory. 

## Idea Flow
Hopefully the ideas and concepts you jotted down during your brain-storming session were as rivetting as the story I overheard. Every morning, I sit in my office and jot down as many ideas as I can in five minutes. Most of them are not workable for writing or experimentation, but every once in a while a good one surfaces, something that I test at work or fold into a personal projects. This ritual has done wonders for my blog writing lately. 

I'd love to hear your own anecdotes about comparative and absolute advantage, or any reflections on economics and statistics in general. 

Happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy the day with your family, most of us are not saving lives out here in the corporate world, so spend that precious time with the people you care about.
