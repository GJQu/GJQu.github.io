<p>Happy Thanksgiving, everyone, I am keeping today’s blog on the shorter end, an under 5-minute read and I will spare you LaTex equations.</p>

<h2 id="what-do-the-following-have-in-common">What Do the Following Have in Common?</h2>
<p>It’s Thanksgiving morning, so here’s a no-stake brainstorming exercise: spend the next 3 minutes to write down as many ideas as you can, they don’t need to relate to each other. Once you are done, connect the nodes of ideas and map out whatever patterns you can find. Curious for what I wrote down?</p>

<ol>
  <li>Botany</li>
  <li>Adam Smith</li>
  <li>FIFA (the video game by EA)</li>
  <li>Thanksgiving dinner</li>
</ol>

<p>So what do the above have in common, if anything at all? It all started a couple nights ago while I was casually browsing for project ideas during a my study break on Discord. I follow a handful of open-source communities: Ollama, Open WebUI, Godot (the game engine). In one of the Godot voice channels, I stumbled into a conversation between an indie developer and a retired EA game dev.</p>

<h3 id="botany-and-fifa">Botany and FIFA</h3>
<p>The story, as the retired EA developer told it, began with a colleague who’d been hired right after finishing her PhD. She wasn’t the typical game-studio recruit. A friend inside EA had flagged her with a kind of urgent enthusiasm: “You need to scoop her up. She just wrapped her doctorate, and if we don’t grab her, some other studio will.” That was enough to get her a full panel interview.</p>

<p>When they sat down and asked about her PhD, she gave an answer that stopped the room cold: “Botany.” Not machine learning, not game development, but botany. The scientific study of plants. And, as she later explained, she hadn’t learned to code until she began doing simulations for her dissertation. You can imagine the interviewers exchanging those tiny sideways glances, trying to stay polite while wondering how this candidate had ended up in their engineering pipeline at all.</p>

<p>They tried to feel things out: “Fascinating… do you have any experience with game development? Or… have you played many games?” She thought about it honestly. She wasn’t a gamer. “Not really,” she said, “but I remember watching my boyfriend play one of EA’s racing games, Need for Speed. I did notice something about the maple trees in one of the maps…”</p>

<p>That got their attention.</p>

<p>She went on: “The maple species in that level aren’t native to the region it’s modeled after. The bark pattern is off. And the taller, older trees should have a different bark texture than the younger ones, but the game uses the same pattern for all of them.”</p>

<p>Now the room was stunned. The panel shifted from mere interest to full wide-eyed who is this person?</p>

<p>One interviewer finally cleared his throat: “We actually did research the vegetation, but if we added that level of detail across the whole game, optimizing performance would be a nightmare.”</p>

<p>She didn’t miss a beat. “I think I know a way around that. My dissertation was on computational simulations across plant species and how to optimize them.”</p>

<p>That was the moment everything clicked. They understood why their colleague had pushed so hard to bring her in. She was hired. And over the years, she became one of the people behind the plant physics and environmental systems across multiple EA titles. When players sprint across a perfectly rendered pitch in FIFA and the turf reacts just right, that was her team’s work.</p>

<p>My mind was spinning after hearing this story, until the logic of comparative advantage snapped it back into focus. I haven’t stopped thinking about it since.</p>

<h3 id="adam-smith-joins-the-chat-pun-intended">Adam Smith Joins the Chat (pun intended)</h3>
<p>Here’s a quick refresher of comparative advantage versus absolute advantage:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Comparative advantage is about which producer of goods has lower opportunity cost, in other words, who gives up less while producing the same thing.
    <ul>
      <li>One can say that China has long held a comparative advantage in iPhone assembly.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Absolute advantage describes a producer that can produce something with fewer resources, all else equal.
    <ul>
      <li>The American software industry has enjoyed this for decades, especially since the 1960s.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This concept of comparative and absolute advantages doesn’t just apply to an entire companies or the economy, it applies to individuals too. It was first posited by the economist and philosopher Adam Smith in <em>The Wealth of Nations</em> (1776), although the idea itself is quite ancient and can be traced by to the Roman times or earlier. Below is the famous pin-factory example in the first chapter of the book on the <em>division of labor</em>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were employed, and where some of them consequently performed two or three distinct operations. But though they were very poor, and therefore but indifferently accommodated with the necessary machinery, they could, when they exerted themselves, make among them about twelve pounds of pins in a day. There are in a pound upwards of four thousand pins of a middling size. Those ten persons, therefore, could make among them upwards of forty-eight thousand pins in a day.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Smith pointed out that if those same workers attempted the entire process independently, chances are they won’t even manage twenty pins a day. He was a big proponent of free trade, pushing for trade based on productive superiority (absolute advantage) rather than the targeted mercantilism of his era.</p>

<p>Later on, David Ricardo extended Smith’s ideas in 1817. He showed that absolute advantage cannot explain all trade. Comparative advantage, where opportunity cost of a producer determines the pareto-efficient (term not yet used at his time) outcome of international trade. This reveals that even a country superior at everything still benefits from specializing where it gives up the least. Trade becomes mutually beneficial not because of dominance, but because of relative sacrifice.</p>

<p>Both comparative advantage and absolute advantage show up today in patterns of specialization and productivity differences in various economic models.</p>

<h3 id="thanksgiving-dishes-and-the-division-of-labor">Thanksgiving Dishes and the Division of Labor</h3>
<p>Every year, my family gets together to make our spread of holiday dishes. I’m the one in charge of the cranberry sauce and a potato-and-ham casserole. My father is up at 6 a.m. tending the brisket or ribeye in the smoker, while my mom handles the desserts and the turkey. Over the years, my cranberry sauce has evolved into a Thanksgiving staple. My father’s smoked ribeye has become so popular that it reliably draws family friends to our table—and brings a bit of extra stress with it. I’m sure your own family and friends have their version of this division of labor during the holiday rush.</p>

<p>We are not explicitly trading our products of labor during thanksgiving day, but the dish-prepping process itself is eerily similar to that gripping story of the game studio developer, and Adam Smith’s pin-factory.</p>

<h2 id="idea-flow">Idea Flow</h2>
<p>Hopefully the ideas and concepts you jotted down during your brain-storming session were as rivetting as the story I overheard. Every morning, I sit in my office and jot down as many ideas as I can in five minutes. Most of them are not workable for writing or experimentation, but every once in a while a good one surfaces, something that I test at work or fold into a personal projects. This ritual has done wonders for my blog writing lately.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your own anecdotes about comparative and absolute advantage, or any reflections on economics and statistics in general.</p>

<p>Happy Thanksgiving. Enjoy the day with your family, most of us are not saving lives out here in the corporate world, so spend that precious time with the people you care about.</p>
