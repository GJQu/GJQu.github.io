It was in the beginning of March when I had the idea of writing my dissertation on causal inference, for those in the industry - A/B testing. I was in the midst of my public policy evaluation class which is more or less based on *Mostly Harmless Econometrics* by Angrist & Pischke and *Causal Inference: The Mixtape* by Scott Cunningham. 

## The Initial Idea 
One morning, after I finished listening to the *Freakonomics* podcast and there was one topic where I remembered clearly, it was about the discrepancy of wealth building between married couples and co-inhabiting couples. My idea is to study the effect of marital status on one's earning, influenced by the theory and building on many empirical assumptions that there's a gender bias when it comes to earning, specifically for women. So the obvious question is why would women get married if they're more likely to suffer from a loss in earning? Now, this is building on previous empirical research and many modeling assumptions. I wanted to conduct my own research on this topic, but using the [UKHLS Understanding Society Dataset](https://www.understandingsociety.ac.uk/about/british-household-panel-survey/).
