I want to start this post by thanking those who supported me and kept me sane throughout this journey of economic research and data science, especially my advisor, Dr. David Zentler-Munro, at the University of Essex.

## A Little Background
As with all “great” data science projects, you first develop all the research questions and then train the model based on your given data. Right?

Of course, assuming you want to discover halfway through that you don’t have the data in the right format and the missing values are imputed incorrectly based on your proxy variables.
