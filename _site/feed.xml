<p>Therefore, I will be updating my blog periodically to document my journey of learning Machine Learning (ML) from theory to application, and the mathematics behind it. My exposure to ML initially is through <a href="https://davidzentlermunro.github.io/">David Zentler-Munro’s</a> course “Data Science for Economics” at the University of Essex, where I am currently studying as a MS Economics student.</p>

<p>I am currently working on my dissertation in labor economics where I will incorporate some of these ML techniques to augment econometric techniques.</p>

<h2 id="books-and-other-resources">Books and Other Resources</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</em> (also known as ISLP for Python or ISLR for R)</li>
  <li><em><a href="https://mml-book.github.io/book/mml-book.pdf">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a></em></li>
  <li><em>The Elements of Statistical Learning</em></li>
  <li><em><a href="https://wesmckinney.com/book/">Python for Data Anlysis</a></em></li>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.deeplearningbook.org/">Deep Learning</a></em> by Ian Goodfellow et al</li>
  <li><em>Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch</em>
    <ul>
      <li>This comes as both a book and a comprehensive <a href="https://course.fast.ai/Resources/book.html">online course</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Math and Coding:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Gilbert Strang’s course and 3blue1brown on Youtube both have been tremendously helpful with my foundations of matrix algebra.</li>
  <li>Harvard’s <em>CS50x</em> for more basic programming knowledge.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="objectives-for-2024">Objectives for 2024</h2>
<p>This is not meant to be the be-all and end-all of my ML journey, but it’ll be the primer for more projects to come.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Develop my own model and showcase it in a sensible application.</li>
  <li>Write blogs documenting the failures (and the successes hopefully).</li>
  <li>Finish my master’s dissertation.</li>
  <li>Convince my girlfriend that orange belongs with chocolate.</li>
</ol>

<p>Along the way, I will also keep up with computer science foundational topics such as algorithms and data structure, computer architecture, etc. I will be largely following this curriculum at <em><a href="https://teachyourselfcs.com/">Teach Yourself CS</a></em>.</p>
